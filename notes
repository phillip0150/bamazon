Challenge #1: Customer View

My Program will first display all the items, then asks the user the ID of the product they would like to buy.
If a user enters a ID that doesn't exist, a message will prompt the user that the items doesn't exist

The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.
If a users enters a unit of numbers that is too much, a message will prompt the user to enter a different number.
if the store does have enough of the product, the customer's order is fulfilled.

Once the order is fulfilled, the program restarts.
